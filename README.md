American football is a complex sport, but once an offensive player receives a handoff or catches a pass, all 11 defenders focus on one task -- tackle that ball carrier as soon as possible. Conversely, the ball carrier's role is to advance the ball down the field to gain as much yardage as possible until he is tackled, scores, or runs out of bounds.

This year's competition offers up a general goal — create metrics that assign value to elements of tackling. You can access the NFL’s Next Gen Stats data as in previous competitions. This year's player tracking includes data from Weeks 1-9 of the 2022 NFL season. Data will show the location, speed, and acceleration of all 22 players on the field, along with football location. Additional PFF scouting data and NFL advanced stats such as expected points and win probability are also included.

Top winners will be invited to present their results to the NFL, where one team will receive an additional prize. NFL teams may also use the most useful new metrics or analysis to evaluate both their offensive and defensive players.

Examples to consider
Your challenge is generating actionable, practical, and novel insights from player tracking data corresponding to tackling. Examples include, but are not limited to:

Predictions of tackle time, probability, and/or location
Tackle range: angle of pursuit, speed and acceleration, closing speed
Player evaluation (e.g, yards saved, tackle value, missed tackles)
Credit assignment (e.g, one player makes a tackle because of another players, blocks shed, area of influence)
Tackle type (solo vs gang, open field vs in the trenches, etc)
Team and player roles and responsibilities (setting the edge, filling gaps, etc)
Note that the above list is not exhaustive, and we encourage participants to be creative with their submissions.
